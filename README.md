# Asteroids-Game
My super awesome asteroids clone, basic framework was done for 
my final test program in introduction to computer science, then I added lots of awesome extra credit. 
The game was created using the object draw library which makes using graphics in java simpler,

I've upload both the .java and .class files, i'm fairly new to git so I'm not sure what the protocol is

Here is a brief overview of each class
Asteroidsgame: the class in which the java applet will be run and 
where the game specs (number of total possible asteroids, number of starting asteroids, etc.) are configured 

Then, the asteroids, spaceship, and bullet classes, implement each of those respective objects. I'm especially proud
of the code in spaceship designed to make the ship drift or glide in a direction even after the user has stopped
pressing the arrow key, giving the game a more realisitic vibe

The scorekeeper classes helps keep track of whether the user has lost or won, it could probably be implemented within
the asteroidsgame class
